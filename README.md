# hardware design branch #

This branch of copyleft-next project is for considering revisions to the
copyleft-next license that are specific to licensing hardware designs. Those 
considerations may relate to legal differences specific to hardware designs,
such as incorporating language into the license that directly addresses laws 
specific to "mask works" (see, for example, 17 U.S.C. §904(b)(1)). Other 
differences may simply educational or "technical", such as providing non-software 
design examples, or including legal notices that are contain a mask mark Ⓜ 
instead of a copyright mark ©. 

I'm not entirely sure where this is going, but, I currently have an interest in 
licensing hardware designs, so I figure I will take what I learn and put it into 
the platonic ideal of the always-becoming copyleft-next.

## copyleft-next ##

copyleft-next is a new, post-post-modern, non-weak copyleft license
inspired by, though different from, the GNU GPL.

Contributions of patches, ideas, and criticism are welcome (see the
file CONTRIBUTING.md for more information).  In particular, the
Copyleft-Next Project actively seeks the participation of open
source/free software project developers who may not have considered
helping with license drafting before. License drafting is
fundamentally about establishing policies for projects, and therefore
input from developers of the highest value.

Numbered releases of copyleft-next are stored in the Releases directory. A
draft of copyleft-next is maintained in the Drafts directory.

**The Copyleft-Next Project is *not* an effort endorsed by the Free
Software Foundation or the GNU Project. It is is also *not* an effort
associated in any way with the past or current employer of any participant.**
Contributors are expected and assumed to participate in their individual
capacity.
